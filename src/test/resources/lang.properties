constructviewsadv=This page will allow you to construct database queries using SQL. \n\n Type each clause of the SQL statement into the appropriate field below. There's no need to enter the SQL command that appears immediately before the field (e.g. SELECT, FROM, etc.): the ORDS will supply this automatically (and will delete it if it is entered). \n\n Pre-written SQL queries can be pasted into the SELECT field: the ORDS will divide the query into its component parts and distribute it appropriately. You can also simply start typing a complete SQL statement in the SELECT field: if the ORDS detects that you have entered a command that belongs in another field, it will move you there automatically. \n\n If you would like to learn more about how to construct SQL queries, there are plenty of books and online guides available. A brief overview can be found in the <a href="http://help.it.ox.ac.uk/research/ords/howto07#Querying-using-sql" target="_blank">ORDS documentation</a>, and W3schools.com offers a helpful <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/sql/" target="_blank">SQL tutorial</a>. \n\n If you would like to save a copy of the results of your query, you can export the results as a CSV file. For full projects, project owners, administrators, and contributors can also save the results as an ORDS dataset.
constructviews=This screen will allow you to construct simple database queries. Please note that this tool is a work in progress.

This allows users to access data stored in the ORDS via another database application (Microsoft Access, for example), or via a custom-built Web front-end. This can provide a way of combining the advantages of multiple systems. \n\n For more information about the ORDS and ODBC connections, visit the <a href="http://help.it.ox.ac.uk/research/ords/odbc" target="_blank">IT Services help site</a>. If you need help setting up an ODBC connection, please contact the ORDS help desk by emailing <a href="mailto:ords@it.ox.ac.uk?Subject=ODBC%20connections%20in%20ORDS">ords@it.ox.ac.uk</a>.\n\nWhen creating an ODBC connection using an external client, you need to ensure that SSL is set to allow (i.e. on).

sdshowhelp=Show help
sdinteger_help=A whole number, negative or positive.
sddecimal_help=A number (negative or positive) which may contain a decimal point. Recommended for cases where a high degree of accuracy is required. \n\n To set a maximum number of digits for this field, enter two figures separated by a comma in the Size field below, in the format x,y - where x is the maximum total number of digits, and y is the maximum number of digits following the decimal point. \n\n Note that if only one figure is entered, ORDS will treat this as the value for x, and assume that y is a zero. In practice, this means the field will only be able to contain integers, and any existing data will be truncated; to avoid this, either leave the field blank, or ensure two figures are entered.
sdsingle_precision_help=A number (negative or positive) which may include a decimal point. Precision (i.e. the number of significant figures, before or after the decimal point) is limited to 6 digits, meaning that rounding of large or small numbers may occur. Where greater precision is required, use Decimal.
sddouble_precision_help=A number (negative or positive) which may include a decimal point. Precision (i.e. the number of significant figures, before or after the decimal point) is limited to 15 digits, meaning that rounding of large or small numbers may occur. Where greater precision is required, use Decimal.
sdchar_help=Can contain text, numbers, or a combination of these. \n\n Char fields have a fixed length. To set this, enter a number of characters in the Size field below. If no length is specified, the field will be limited to a single character.
sdvarchar_help=Can contain text, numbers, or a combination of these. \n\n To restrict the length of this field, enter a maximum number of characters in the Size field below.
sdtext_help=Can contain text, numbers, or a combination of these. The length of Text fields is not restricted.
sdbinary_help=Help for Binary type
sdvarbinary_help=Help for Varbinary type
sdblob_help=Help for Blob type
sddate_help=A date consisting of a day, month, and year. The format YYYY-MM-DD should be used.
sdtime_help=A time of day, consisting of hours, minutes, and seconds.  The format hh:mm:ss should be used.
sddatetime_help=Help for Datetime type
sdyear_help=Help for Year type
sdtimestamp_help=A concatenation of a date and a time. The format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss should be used.
sdenum_help=Help for Enum type
sdset_help=Help for Set type
sdbit_help=Used to store bit strings (strings of data consisting entirely of 0s and 1s). \n\n Bit fields have a fixed length. To set this, enter a number of digits in the Size field below. If no length is specified, the field will be limited to a single digit.
sdbigint_help=A whole number, negative or positive. \n\n This data type can be used for numbers between -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 and 9,223,372,036,854,775,807. Use when the range permitted for the Integer data type is not sufficient.
sdreal_help=A number (negative or positive) which may include a decimal point. Precision (i.e. the number of significant figures, before or after the decimal point) is limited to 6 digits, meaning that rounding of large or small numbers may occur. Where greater precision is required, use Decimal.
sdbytea_help=Used for raw binary data (that is, data consisting of 0s and 1s), stored as hexadecimal strings.
sdboolean_help=Used for data restricted to one of a pair of values - e.g. true or false, yes or no, or 0 or 1. In ORDS, fields with this data type will be displayed as a check box.
sdtablenamedisabled=Once a table's structure has been saved, its name cannot be edited through ORDS.
sddone=Done
sdbasictypes=Basic Data Types
sdsavepleasewait=Please wait while your data is copied to the new schema.  This may take a few moments for large databases.
sdsaveconfirm=This will replace your current database with the edited version shown here. Are you sure you want to continue?
sdchangessaved=Changes saved!
sdquit=Exit
sdconfirmquit=Are you sure you want to exit? Any unsaved changes will be lost.
sdconfirmload=This will revert any unsaved changes you have made to the schema. Are you sure you want to continue?
sddatatypewarning1=Fields with the data type Char are by default restricted to a single character. Any existing entries longer than this will be truncated. Once changes to the database structure have been saved, it will not be possible to restore any data lost through this action. \n\n (To increase the size of the field, click Cancel and enter the desired value in the Size field.)
sddatatypewarning2=You have chosen to reduce the size of this field. Any existing entries longer than the specified size will be truncated. Once changes to the database structure have been saved, it will not be possible to restore any data lost through this action.
sddatatypewarning3=You have chosen to change the data type of this field. Any existing entries not compatible with the new data type will be truncated. Once changes to the database structure have been saved, it will not be possible to restore any data lost through this action.
sddatatypewarning4=Decimal fields can have a size entered in the format x,y - where x is the maximum total number of digits, and y is the maximum number of digits following the decimal point. \n\n To continue with no size specified, click OK.  To enter a size, click Cancel.
vqdselecttables=Select the tables to include in the query
vqdunjoineddbwarning=Some of the tables you've chosen for this query are not connected by any relationships. This means that the query will be interpreted as a CROSS JOIN with the unjoined tables, which is rarely what's intended (it will result in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product" target="_blank">Cartesian product</a> of all the records of the selected tables). To fix this, you may need to select additional tables from the list above so that all tables are connected, add relationships to the database in the schema designer, or manually add a WHERE clause to the SQL below. Please contact the <a href="mailto:ords@it.ox.ac.uk">ORDS help desk</a> for further advice.
